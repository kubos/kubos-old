 * -NOTE- The Win32 port is a simulation (or is that emulation?) only!  Do not
 * expect to get real time behaviour from the Win32 port or this demo
 * application.  It is provided as a convenient development and demonstration
 * test bed only.  This was tested using Windows XP on a dual core laptop.
 *
 * In this example, one simulated millisecond will take approximately 40ms to
 * execute.  See the documentation page for the Windows simulator for an 
 * explanation of the slow timing:
 * http://www.freertos.org/FreeRTOS-Windows-Simulator-Emulator-for-Visual-Studio-and-Eclipse-MingW.html
 ******************************************************************************
 *
 * This is a simple FreeRTOS Windows simulator project that makes it easy to 
 * evaluate CyaSSL in a FreeRTOS environment on a standard desktop PC, and 
 * without any external hardware or interfaces being required.
 *
 * main() creates a TCP server task, which initialises CyaSSL, before creating a
 * TCP client task.  Both the server and client use TLS secured sockets.
 *
 * The client task repeatedly connects to the server, sends 10 messages, then 
 * disconnects.  The server task prints the contents of each message to the
 * console as they are received.
 *
 * CyaSSL objects are created and deleted as each socket connects and
 * disconnects respectively.
 *
 * The server task is implemented in SecureTCPServerTask.c, and the client task
 * in SecureTCPClientTask.c.
 *
 * Visit http://www.FreeRTOS.org/ssl for FreeRTOS + CyaSSL for demo 
 * documentation.

/* This application is using the FreeRTOS Windows simulator, which uses the
FreeRTOS scheduler to schedule FreeRTOS task within the Windows environment.
The Windows environment must not be allowed to block any Windows threads that
are running FreeRTOS tasks, unless the FreeRTOS task is running at the FreeRTOS
idle priority.  For simplicity, this demo uses the Windows TCP/IP stack, the
API for which can cause Windows threads to block.  Therefore, any FreeRTOS task
that makes calls to the Windows TCP/IP stack must be assigned the idle priority.
Note this is only a restriction of the simulated Windows environment - real
FreeRTOS ports do not have this restriction. */
