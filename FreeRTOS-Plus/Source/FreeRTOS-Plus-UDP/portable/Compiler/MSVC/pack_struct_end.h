 * This file is part of the FreeRTOS+UDP distribution.  The FreeRTOS+UDP license

 *
 * FreeRTOS+UDP uses a dual license model that allows the software to be used 
 * under a standard GPL open source license, or a commercial license.  The 
 * standard GPL license (unlike the modified GPL license under which FreeRTOS 
 * itself is distributed) requires that all software statically linked with 
 * FreeRTOS+UDP is also distributed under the same GPL V2 license terms.  
 * Details of both license options follow:
 *
 * - Open source licensing -
 * FreeRTOS+UDP is a free download and may be used, modified, evaluated and
 * distributed without charge provided the user adheres to version two of the
 * GNU General Public License (GPL) and does not remove the copyright notice or
 * this text.  The GPL V2 text is available on the gnu.org web site, and on the
 * following URL: http://www.FreeRTOS.org/gpl-2.0.txt.
 *
 * - Commercial licensing -
 * Businesses and individuals that for commercial or other reasons cannot comply
 * with the terms of the GPL V2 license must obtain a commercial license before 
 * incorporating FreeRTOS+UDP into proprietary software for distribution in any 
 * form.  Commercial licenses can be purchased from http://shop.freertos.org/udp 
 * and do not require any source files to be changed.
 *
 * FreeRTOS+UDP is distributed in the hope that it will be useful.  You cannot
 * use FreeRTOS+UDP unless you agree that you use the software 'as is'.
 * FreeRTOS+UDP is provided WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied
 * warranties of NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
 * PURPOSE. Real Time Engineers Ltd. disclaims all conditions and terms, be they
