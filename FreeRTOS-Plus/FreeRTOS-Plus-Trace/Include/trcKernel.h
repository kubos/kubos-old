 * When queues are closed, arg1 is the "state" property (i.e., number of 
 * buffered messages/signals).
 * When actors are closed, arg1 is priority, arg2 is handle of the "instance 
 * finish" event, and arg3 is event code of the "instance finish" event. 
 * In this case, the lower three bits is the object class of the instance finish 
 * handle. The lower three bits are not used (always zero) when queues are 
 * closed since the queue type is given in the previous OBJCLOSE_NAME event.

/******************************************************************************
 * XTS Event - eXtended TimeStamp events
 * The timestamps used in the recorder are "differential timestamps" (DTS), i.e.
 * the time since the last stored event. The DTS fields are either 1 or 2 bytes 
 * in the other events, depending on the bytes available in the event struct. 
 * If the time since the last event (the DTS) is larger than allowed for by 
 * the DTS field of the current event, an XTS event is inserted immidiatly 
 * before the original event. The XTS event contains up to 3 additional bytes 
 * of the DTS value - the higher bytes of the true DTS value. The lower 1-2 
 * bytes are stored in the normal DTS field. 
 * There are two types of XTS events, XTS8 and XTS16. An XTS8 event is stored 
 * when there is only room for 1 byte (8 bit) DTS data in the original event, 
 * which means a limit of 0xFF (255). The XTS16 is used when the original event 
 * has a 16 bit DTS field and thereby can handle values up to 0xFFFF (65535).
 * 
 * Using a very high frequency time base can result in many XTS events. 
 * Preferably, the time between two OS ticks should fit in 16 bits, i.e.,
 * at most 65535. If your time base has a higher frequency, you can define
 * the TRACE
