BME280 Sensor API
=================

API for the `BME280 humidity and pressure sensor <https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/datasheets/BST-BME280_DS001-10.pdf>`__

Enabling this sensor code requires certain configuration values to be present
in the application's configuration json. An example is given below:

::

     {
         "sensors": {
             "bme280": {
                 "spi_bus": "K_SPI1",
                 "CS":"PA4"
             }
         }
     }
 
This would enable the bme280 sensor code and configure it for the SPI bus
K_SPI1 with chip select PA4.

See the :ref:`spi-example` for an example of how to use this sensor.
