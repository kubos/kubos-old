Kubos SDK Docs
==============

The "Kubos SDK" is a term used to describe all of the components used
to build Kubos projects:

-  Vagrant box - The VM that contains the "ready to run" Kubos development
   environment
-  Kubos CLI - The command-line tool used to create, configure, build
   and debug Kubos projects
-  Kubos source modules - the underlying libraries on which Kubos projects 
   are built
