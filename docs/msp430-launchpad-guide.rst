Pin Definitions
---------------

Unlike the STM32F4, there is only a single set of pin definitions for
each communication bus.

**Note:** There are two UART buses present in the launchpad. However,
UART2 is piped through to the micro-USB port and is reserved for console
output.

Finding the Pin Definitions for a Board
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to locate the pin assignments for the MSP430 launchpad, please
refer to the following documents.

MSPEXP430F5529LP Quick Launch Guide:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The first page of the `MSPEXP430F5529LP Quick Launch
Guide <http://www.ti.com/lit/ml/slau536/slau536.pdf>`__ has a pin
diagram for the board. The primary I2C, SPI, and UART buses are
color-coded.

-  I2C pins - UCB\_n\_\_{SCL\|SDA}
-  SPI pins - UC\_cn\_\_{SIMO\|SOMI\|CLK}
-  UART pins - UCA0\_{TXD\|RXD}

MSP430F5529 Launchpad User's Guide:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The full pinout schematic of the processor can be found in section 2.2.1
of the `MSP430F5529 LaunchPad User's
Guide <http://www.ti.com/lit/ug/slau533d/slau533d.pdf>`__.

Startup Code
------------

Each project will contain a main() function.

--------------

**SUPER IMPORTANT** The MSP430's watchdog is on by default. It must
be manually turned off at the start of your program or you must create a
task to feed the watchdog. If you don't, the watchdog will continually
be starved and reboot your board.

--------------

You should also make a call to enable interrupts at startup.

Your main() should look something like this:

::

    int main(void) {

        /* Stop the watchdog. */
        WDTCTL = WDTPW + WDTHOLD;
        
        __enable_interrupt();
        
        xTaskCreate(task_blink, "blink", configMINIMAL_STACK_SIZE * 4, NULL, 2, NULL);
         
        vTaskStartScheduler();
        
        return 0;
    }

Configuration Notes
-------------------

The MSP430's inter-device communication methods do not support all of
the same options as the STM32F4. For example, the MSP430 does not
support 1-wire half-duplex SPI communication. Please refer to the User's
Guide or the FIXME: `MSP430's HAL
Documentation <./kubos-hal/kubos-hal-msp430f5529/index.html>`__ for all
of the supported options.

`UART <kubos-hal/uart_api.html#_CPPv29KUARTConf>`__ - Word length - Does not
support 9-bit mode

`I2C <kubos-hal/i2c_api.html#_CPPv28KI2CConf>`__ - Currently has all the same
capabilities as the STM32F4

`SPI <kubos-hal/spi_api.html#_CPPv28KSPIConf>`__ - Direction - Does not support
1-line mode - Data Size - Does not support 16-bit mode

Flashing the Board
------------------

Once you've built your project, you'll flash it onto your board using
the micro-USB port. You might need to install drivers in order for the
board to be properly detected by your computer. If you're using Windows,
the drivers can be found
`here <http://software-dl.ti.com/msp430/msp430_public_sw/mcu/msp430/MSP430_FET_Drivers/latest/index_FDS.html>`__.

If you have a Kubos vagrant image running, the USB connection should be
automatically passed through to the VM. The board should appear as the
"Texas Instruments" device if you issue the ``lsusb`` command. Run
``kubos flash`` in order to start the flash process.

If you see a "*No unused FET found*" message, the board either isn't
plugged into your computer or some other VM has control of the USB (only
one VM can have control of the USB at a time).

If you see any other error messages, like "*device initialization
failed*" re-run the flash command.

**Note:** The MSP430 flasher can be finicky. It may take several
attempts to successfully flash the board. If you reach a state where
you've run the flash commands many times and it still won't complete
successfully, try restarting your machine/VM.

The output of a successful flash should look like this:

If something happens to the board's flashing firmware
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It's possible for the version of the board's internal firmware to be
out-of-date from what the flash application is looking for. In this
case, the ``kubos flash`` command will automatically kick off the
firmware updater.

(This is guaranteed to happen if you change the OS of the computer that
the board is connected to.)

It will look something like this:

If you're using a VM, the "Texas Instruments MSP Tools Driver" device
name might no longer be present after running the command.

If that occurs, try selecting the "Unknown device" devices and
re-running the ``kubos flash`` command. The command should cause some
additional firmware to be loaded and the usual device name should appear
once it completes.

Select the "Texas Instruments MSP Tools Driver" device again and rerun
the flash command one more time. You should see firmware upload
messages, followed by your program being flashed to the board.

Debug Console
-------------

You can view the MSP430's console output by creating a serial connection
to the micro-USB port. If you're using Windows, the connection will
appear in Device Manager as "MSP Application UART1". The default
connection speed is 115200.

All of your program's printf statements will be routed through here. You
can change the settings of the console with the :json:object:`hardware.console` section
of the config.json file.

**NOTE:** If your MSP430 board loses power while you have a debug
console connection open, you might need to close the current console and
turn the board off and back on again in order to create a new successful
console session.

Example Program
---------------

Let's create a basic MSP430 program.

The goal is to create a program that will output a message once a
second. Additionally, a message should be issued when button 0 (P2.1) is
pressed.

Note: This is more simple than the STM32F4 example program because there
are no inter-device pins that can be connected to each other. UART2 is
dedicated to the debug console and slave mode hasn't been implemented
for I2C or SPI.

The Walkthrough:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Create the project

::

    $ kubos init msp-test

Create the program in main.c:

Set the target

::

    $ kubos target msp430f5529-gcc

Build the program

::

    $ kubos build

Flash the program

::

    $ kubos flash

Connect to the debug console. Should see an "echo, x=\ *n*" message
every second. If you press the P2.1 button, you should see "Button\_0
pressed".
