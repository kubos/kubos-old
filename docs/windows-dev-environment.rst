Setting up the Kubos Windows Development Environment
====================================================

What is the Kubos Windows Development Environment?
--------------------------------------------------

The Kubos Windows Development Environment is a way to edit files on the SDK through an IDE. Since Windows does not support symlinks, editing the files can be a pain, as they are only accessible to tools within the SDK, such as vim or nano. This guide walks through a single method to edit those files through an IDE on the host machine, rather than through these command line tools. 


Installation:
-------------

The chosen environment consists of:

- Notepad++
- nppftp 
  
Install Notepad++ `here <https://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/v7.4.2.html>`__
