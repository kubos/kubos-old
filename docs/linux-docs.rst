KubOS Linux
===========

KubOS Linux is a custom Linux distribution designed with embedded devices in mind.

It focuses on including only drivers that are useful for space applications (ex. 
I2C and SPI, rather than display drivers) and multi-layer system validation and 
recovery logic.

KubOS Linux projects are built into binaries which will run as Linux user space 
applications.
