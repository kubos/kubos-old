Kubos Documentation

TODO: This page could be a little flashier...

The Kubos platform provides small satellite developers the tools and
libraries necessary to quickly bring up space ready software. We
leverage multiple existing open source projects like FreeRTOS and CSP,
along with our own custom framework and SDK.

TODO: Fancy super high level architecture image

Looking to build an application on Kubos? Check out our :doc:`KubOS RT 
quick start guide <first-rt-project>` or our :doc:`KubOS Linux quick 
start guide <first-linux-project>`

TODO: Maybe buttons instead for RT and Linux links?
