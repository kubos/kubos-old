# Kubos Continuous Integration

This repository contains files used in the continuous integration testing for Kubos software. The code in this repository assumes the use of certain custom hardware, and thus may not work without similar hardware available to the end user. Kubos uses a core server to compile software, and less powerful single board computers to flash the software and record/report testing data.
