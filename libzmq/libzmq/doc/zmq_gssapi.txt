NAME
----
zmq_gssapi - secure authentication and confidentiality


SYNOPSIS
--------

The GSSAPI mechanism defines a mechanism for secure authentication and
confidentiality for communications between a client and a server using the
Generic Security Service Application Program Interface (GSSAPI).  The GSSAPI
mechanism can be used on both public and private networks.  GSSAPI itself is
defined in IETF RFC-2743: <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2743>. The ZeroMQ
GSSAPI mechanism is defined by this document: <http://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:38>.


CLIENT AND SERVER ROLES
-----------------------
A socket using GSSAPI can be either client or server, but not both.

To become either a GSSAPI client or server, the application sets the
ZMQ_GSSAPI_PRINCIPAL option to provide the socket with the name of the principal
for whom GSSAPI credentials should be acquired.

To become a GSSAPI server, the application additionally sets the
ZMQ_GSSAPI_SERVER option on the socket.

To become a GSSAPI client, the application additionally sets the
ZMQ_GSSAPI_SERVICE_PRINCIPAL option to the name of the principal of the server
to which it intends to connect.


OPTIONAL ENCRYPTION
-------------------
By default, the GSSAPI mechanism will encrypt all communications between client
and server.  If encryption is not desired (e.g. on private networks), the
client and server applications can disable it by setting the
ZMQ_GSSAPI_PLAINTEXT option.  Both the client and server must set this option
to the same value.
