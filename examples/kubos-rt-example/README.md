# KubOS RT Example App

This is a simple application built on top of the [KubOS RT Platform](https://github.com/kubostech/KubOS-rt) demonstrating some basic functionality from KubOS-RT (CSP, UART, FreeRTOS). 

The easiest way to get started building this is with the [KubOS SDK](http://docs.kubos.co/latest/md_docs_kubos-sdk.html).
