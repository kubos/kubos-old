# KubOS Linux Example App

This is a simple application built on top of the [KubOS Linux Platform](https://github.com/kubostech/kubos-linux-build) 
demonstrating some basic functionality from KubOS Linux (CSP). 

The easiest way to get started building this is with the [KubOS SDK](http://docs.kubos.co/latest/md_docs_kubos-sdk.html).
