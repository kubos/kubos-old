This directory contains the a generic trace recorder library for Tracealyzer v3.0.2.

For information on how to upload the trace data from your target system RAM to 
Tracealyzer, see the User Manual.

Files included
--------------
- trcConfig.h             		- The recorder's configuration file, set your recorder configuration here!
- trcUser.c/.h            		- The main API towards the application (trcUser.h in the only include necessary).
- trcKernel.c/.h          		- Internal routines for storing kernel events.
- trcBase.c/.h            		- Internal routines for manipulating the data structures and calculating timestamps.
- trcHardwarePort.c/.h    		- The hardware interface, especially for timestamping.
- trcKernelPort.h  				- Wrapper for trcKernelPortFreeRTOS.h (for portability).
- trcKernelPortFreeRTOS.c/.h  	- FreeRTOS-specific trace macros and helper functions.
- trcKernelHooks.h        		- Generic trace macros (OS independent), used by trcKernelPortFreeRTOS.
- trcTypes.h              		- Type definitions used.

Hardware Timer Ports
--------------------
This release contains hardware timer ports for the following hardware architectures:

- ARM Cortex M3/M4/M0/M0+ (all brands, such as Atmel SAM3x/SAM4x/SAM D20, NXP 17xx, 18xx, 43xx, STM32, Freescale Kinetis, ...)
- Atmel AT91SAM7x
- Atmel AT32UC3 (AVR32)
- Renesas RX600 (e.g., RX62N)
- Microchip dsPIC/PIC24
- Microchip PIC32MX
- Microchip PIC32MZ
- NXP LPC2106
- Texas Instruments TMS570 (Cortex-R4)
- Texas Instruments MSP430
- Xilinx PowerPC 405
- Xilinx PowerPC 440
- Xilinx Microblaze
- ARM Cortex-A9

These are defined in trcHardwarePort.h. Some of these are "unofficial" ports, provided by external contributors.
By unofficial, it means that they are not yet verified by Percepio AB. Please refer to trcHardwarePort.h for detailed information. 
If you use an unofficial port and believe it is incorrect, please let us know! (support@percepio.com)

In case your MCU is not yet supported directly, developing a new port is quite easy, just a matter of defining a few macros
according to your specific MCU. See trcHardwarePort.h for further information.
