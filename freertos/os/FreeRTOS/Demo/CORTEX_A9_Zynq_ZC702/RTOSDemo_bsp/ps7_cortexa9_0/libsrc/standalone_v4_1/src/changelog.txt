 * 3.09a sgd  02/14/13 Fix for CRs 697094 (SI#687034) and 675552.
 * 3.10a srt  04/18/13 Implemented ARM Erratas. 
 *		       Cortex A9 Errata - 742230, 743622, 775420, 794073
 *		       L2Cache PL310 Errata - 588369, 727915, 759370
 *		       Please refer to file 'xil_errata.h' for errata
 *		       description.
 * 3.10a asa  05/04/13 Added support for L2 cache in MicroBlaze BSP. The older
 *		       cache APIs were corresponding to only Layer 1 cache 
 *		       memories. New APIs were now added and the existing cache
 *		       related APIs were changed to provide a uniform interface
 *		       to flush/invalidate/enable/disable the complete cache
 *		       system which includes both L1 and L2 caches. The changes
 *		       for these were done in:
 *		       src/microblaze/xil_cache.c and src/microblaze/xil_cache.h
 *		       files.
 *		       Four new files were added for supporting L2 cache. They are:
 *		       microblaze_flush_cache_ext.S-> Flushes L2 cache
 *		       microblaze_flush_cache_ext_range.S -> Flushes a range of
 *		       memory in L2 cache.
 *		       microblaze_invalidate_cache_ext.S-> Invalidates L2 cache
 *		       microblaze_invalidate_cache_ext_range -> Invalidates a
 *		       range of memory in L2 cache.
 *		       These changes are done to implement PR #697214.	
 * 3.10a  asa 05/13/13 Modified cache disable APIs at src/cortexa9/xil_cache.c to
 *		       fix the CR #706464. L2 cache disabling happens independent
 *		       of L1 data cache disable operation. Changes are done in the
 *		       same file in cache handling APIs to do a L2 cache sync 
 *		       (poll reg7_?cache_?sync). This fixes CR #700542.		       
 * 3.10a asa  05/20/13 Added API/Macros for enabling and disabling nested 
 *		       interrupts for ARM. These are done to fix the CR#699680.
 * 3.10a srt  05/20/13 Made changes in cache maintenance APIs to do a proper cach
 *		       sync operation. This fixes the CR# 716781.
 * 3.11a asa  09/07/13 Updated armcc specific BSP files to have proper support
 *		       for armcc toolchain.
 *		       Modified asm_vectors.S (gcc) and asm_vectors.s (armcc) to
 *		       fix issues related to NEON context saving. The assembly
 *		       routines for IRQ and FIQ handling are modified.
 *		       Deprecated the older BSP (3.10a).
 * 3.11a asa  09/22/13 Fix for CR#732704. Cache APIs are modified to avoid 
 *		       various potential issues. Made changes in the function
 *		       Xil_SetAttributes in file xil_mmu.c.
 * 3.11a asa  09/23/13 Added files xil_misc_psreset_api.c and xil_misc_psreset_api.h
 *		       in src\cortexa9 and src\microblaze folders. 
 * 3.11a asa  09/28/13 Modified the cache APIs (src\cortexa9) to fix handling of
 *		       L2 cache sync operation and to fix issues around complete
 *		       L2 cache flush/invalidation by ways.
 * 3.12a asa  10/22/13 Modified the files xpseudo_asm_rvct.c and xpseudo_asm_rvct.h
 *		       to fix linking issues with armcc/DS-5. Modified the armcc
 *		       makefile to fix issues.
 * 3.12a asa  11/15/13 Fix for CR#754800. It fixes issues around profiling for MB.
 * 4.0   hk   12/13/13 Added check for STDOUT_BASEADDRESS where outbyte is used. 
 * 4.0 	 pkp  22/01/14 Modified return addresses for interrupt handlers (DataAbortHandler
 *		       and SWIHandler) in asm_vector.S (src\cortexa9\gcc\ and 
 *		       src\cortexa9\armcc\) to fix CR#767251
 * 4.0	 pkp  24/01/14 Modified cache APIs (Xil_DCacheInvalidateRange and 
 *		       Xil_L1DCacheInvalidate) in xil_cache.c (src\cortexa9) to fix the bugs.
 *		       Few cache lines were missed to invalidate when unaligned address
 *		       invalidation was accommodated in Xil_DCacheInvalidateRange. 
 *		       In Xil_L1DCacheInvalidate, while invalidating all L1D cache
 *		       stack memory (which contains return address) was invalidated. So
 *		       stack memory is flushed first and then L1D cache is invalidated.
 *		       This is done to fix CR #763829
 * 4.0 adk   22/02/2014 Fixed the CR:775379 removed unnecessay _t(unit32_t etc) from 
 *			mblaze_nt_types.h file and replace uint32_t with u32 in the 
 *			profile_hist.c to fix the above CR. 
 * 4.1 bss   04/14/14  Updated driver tcl to remove _interrupt_handler.o from libgloss.a
 * 		       instead of libxil.a and added prototypes for 
 *		       microblaze_invalidate_cache_ext and microblaze_flush_cache_ext in
 *		       mb_interface.h
 * 4.1 hk    04/18/14  Add sleep function.
 * 4.1 asa   04/21/14  Fix for CR#764881. Added support for msrset and msrclr. Renamed
 *		       some of the *.s files inMB BSP source to *.S.
 * 4.1 asa   04/28/14  Fix for CR#772280. Made changes in file cortexa9/gcc/read.c.
 * 4.1 bss   04/29/14  Modified driver tcl to use libxil.a if libgloss.a does not exist
 *			CR#794205
 * 4.1 asa   05/09/14  Fix for CR#798230. Made changes in cortexa9/xil_cache.c and
 *		       common/xil_testcache.c
 *	               Fix for CR#764881.
