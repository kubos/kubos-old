/*
 * The first test creates three tasks - two counter tasks (one continuous count
 * and one limited count) and one controller.  A "count" variable is shared
 * between all three tasks.  The two counter tasks should never be in a "ready"
 * state at the same time.  The controller task runs at the same priority as
 * the continuous count task, and at a lower priority than the limited count
 * task.
 *
 * One counter task loops indefinitely, incrementing the shared count variable
 * on each iteration.  To ensure it has exclusive access to the variable it
 * raises it's priority above that of the controller task before each
 * increment, lowering it again to it's original priority before starting the
 * next iteration.
 *
 * The other counter task increments the shared count variable on each
 * iteration of it's loop until the count has reached a limit of 0xff - at
 * which point it suspends itself.  It will not start a new loop until the
 * controller task has made it "ready" again by calling vTaskResume ().
 * This second counter task operates at a higher priority than controller
 * task so does not need to worry about mutual exclusion of the counter
 * variable.
 *
 * The controller task is in two sections.  The first section controls and
 * monitors the continuous count task.  When this section is operational the
 * limited count task is suspended.  Likewise, the second section controls
 * and monitors the limited count task.  When this section is operational the
 * continuous count task is suspended.
 *
 * In the first section the controller task first takes a copy of the shared
 * count variable.  To ensure mutual exclusion on the count variable it
 * suspends the continuous count task, resuming it again when the copy has been
 * taken.  The controller task then sleeps for a fixed period - during which
 * the continuous count task will execute and increment the shared variable.
 * When the controller task wakes it checks that the continuous count task
 * has executed by comparing the copy of the shared variable with its current
 * value.  This time, to ensure mutual exclusion, the scheduler itself is
 * suspended with a call to vTaskSuspendAll ().  This is for demonstration
 * purposes only and is not a recommended technique due to its inefficiency.
 *
 * After a fixed number of iterations the controller task suspends the
 * continuous count task, and moves on to its second section.
 *
 * At the start of the second section the shared variable is cleared to zero.
 * The limited count task is then woken from it's suspension by a call to
 * vTaskResume ().  As this counter task operates at a higher priority than
 * the controller task the controller task should not run again until the
 * shared variable has been counted up to the limited value causing the counter
 * task to suspend itself.  The next line after vTaskResume () is therefore
 * a check on the shared variable to ensure everything is as expected.
 *
 *
 * The second test consists of a couple of very simple tasks that post onto a
 * queue while the scheduler is suspended.  This test was added to test parts
 * of the scheduler not exercised by the first test.
