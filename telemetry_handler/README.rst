Telemetry+GraphQL Prototype
===========================

This is a pretty basic prototype of Graphene+SQLAlchemy+Flask
running against the ICEye telemetry database.

This app expects the database to be in a file named `telem.db`
in this folder and will attempt to use the table name `Telemetry`.

The default Telemetry table is pretty large and there are no query limits
built into the code atm. I'd suggest trimming down the table size in the
database before playing.

::

   python ./app.py

This will start a flask server at http://127.0.0.1:5000.
If you go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/graphiql you will find a built-in
GraphiQL interface.

There is a raw HTTP/GraphQL endpoint found at http://127.0.0.1:5000/graphql.

Valid queries will take the form of

::

   {
     telemetry {
       timestamp,
       subsystem
     }
   }


Filtering can be done like so

::

   {
     telemetry(subsystem:"PCM") {
       timestamp,
       subsystem,
       param,
       value
     }
   }
