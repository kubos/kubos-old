/*
 * This is a very simply blinky style example that can be generated
 * automatically by the Xilinx SDK.
 *
 * The example generates a Tx task, an Rx task, and a queue.  The Tx task
 * simply uses the queue to send a value to the Rx task every 500ms.  The Rx
 * prints out a message each time it receives the value.
 *
 * The demo does little in the way of hardware configuration.  Separate projects
 * are provided that include comprehensive demos which demonstrate additional
 * hardware configuration, and additional FreeRTOS features.  See the following
 * link for more details: http://www.freertos.org/a00090.html#XILINX
