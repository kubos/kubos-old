 * This project provides two demo applications.  A simple blinky style project,
 * and a more comprehensive test and demo application.  The
 * mainCREATE_SIMPLE_BLINKY_DEMO_ONLY setting is used to select between the two.  
 * The simply blinky demo is implemented and described in main_blinky.c.  The 
 * more comprehensive test and demo application is implemented and described in 
 * main_full.c.
 *
 * This file implements the code that is not demo specific, including the
 * hardware setup and FreeRTOS hook functions.
 *
 *******************************************************************************
 * -NOTE- The Win32 port is a simulation (or is that emulation?) only!  Do not
 * expect to get real time behaviour from the Win32 port or this demo
 * application.  It is provided as a convenient development and demonstration
 * test bed only.  This was tested using Windows XP on a dual core laptop.
 *
 * In this example, one simulated millisecond will take approximately 40ms to
 * execute, and Windows will not be running the FreeRTOS simulator threads
 * continuously, so the timing information in the FreeRTOS+Trace logs have no
 * meaningful units.  See the documentation page for the Windows simulator for
 * an explanation of the slow timing:
 * http://www.freertos.org/FreeRTOS-Windows-Simulator-Emulator-for-Visual-Studio-and-Eclipse-MingW.html
