 * select between the two.  The simply blinky demo is implemented and described
 * in main_blinky.c.  The more comprehensive test and demo application is
 * implemented and described in main_full.c.

 * This file implements the code that is not demo specific, including the
 * hardware setup and FreeRTOS hook functions.
