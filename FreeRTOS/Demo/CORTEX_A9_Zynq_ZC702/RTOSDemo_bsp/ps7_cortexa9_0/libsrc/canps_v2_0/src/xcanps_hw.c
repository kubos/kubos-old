* This function resets the CAN device. Calling this function resets the device
* immediately, and any pending transmission or reception is terminated at once.
* Both Object Layer and Transfer Layer are reset. This function does not reset
* the Physical Layer. All registers are reset to the default values, and no
* previous status will be restored. TX FIFO, RX FIFO and TX High Priority
* Buffer are also reset.
*
* The CAN device will be in Configuration Mode immediately after this function
* returns.
*
* @param	BaseAddr is the baseaddress of the interface.
*
* @return	None.
*
* @note		None.
