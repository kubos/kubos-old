/******************************************************************************
 * NOTE 1:  This project provides two demo applications.  A simple blinky style
 * project, and a more comprehensive test and demo application.  The
 * mainCREATE_SIMPLE_BLINKY_DEMO_ONLY setting in main.c is used to select
 * between the two.  See the notes on using mainCREATE_SIMPLE_BLINKY_DEMO_ONLY
 * in main.c.  This file implements the comprehensive test and demo version.
 *
 * NOTE 2:  This file only contains the source code that is specific to the
 * full demo.  Generic functions, such FreeRTOS hook functions, and functions
 * required to configure the hardware, are defined in main.c.
 ******************************************************************************
 *
 * main_full() creates all the demo application tasks and software timers, then 
 * starts the scheduler.  The WEB documentation provides more details of the 
 * standard demo application tasks.  In addition to the standard demo tasks, the 
 * following tasks and tests are defined and/or created within this file:
 *
 * "LCD" task - the LCD task is a 'gatekeeper' task.  It is the only task that
 * is permitted to access the display directly.  Other tasks wishing to write a
 * message to the LCD send the message on a queue to the LCD task instead of
 * accessing the LCD themselves.  The LCD task just blocks on the queue waiting
 * for messages - waking and displaying the messages as they arrive.
 *
 * "Check" timer - The check software timer period is initially set to three
 * seconds.  The callback function associated with the check software timer
 * checks that all the standard demo tasks, and the register check tasks, are
 * not only still executing, but are executing without reporting any errors.  If
 * the check software timer discovers that a task has either stalled, or
 * reported an error, then it changes its own execution period from the initial
 * three seconds, to just 200ms.  The check software timer callback function
 * also writes a status message to the LCD (via the LCD task).  If all the demo 
 * tasks are executing with their expected behaviour then the check task writes 
 * a count of the number of times the high frequency interrupt has incremented
 * ulHighFrequencyTimerInterrupts - which is one in every 20,000 interrupts.
 *
 * "Register test" tasks - These tasks are used in part to test the kernel port.
 * They set each processor register to a known value, then check that the 
 * register still contains that value.  Each of the tasks sets the registers
 * to different values, and will get swapping in and out between setting and 
 * then subsequently checking the register values.  Discovery of an incorrect
 * value would be indicative of an error in the task switching mechanism.
 *
 * By way of demonstration, the demo application defines 
 * configMAX_SYSCALL_INTERRUPT_PRIORITY to be 3, configKERNEL_INTERRUPT_PRIORITY 
 * to be 1, and all other interrupts as follows:
 *
 *	+ The UART is allocated a priority of 2. This means it can interrupt the 
 *    RTOS tick, and can also safely use queues.
 *  + Two timers are configured to generate interrupts just to test the nesting 
 *    and queue access mechanisms. These timers are allocated priorities 2 and 3 
 *    respectively. Even though they both access the same two queues, the 
 *    priority 3 interrupt can safely interrupt the priority 2 interrupt. Both 
 *    can interrupt the RTOS tick.
 *  + Finally a high frequency timer interrupt is configured to use priority 4 - 
 *    therefore kernel activity will never prevent the high frequency timer from 
 *    executing immediately that the interrupt is raised (within the limitations 
 *    of the hardware itself). It would not be safe to access a queue from this 
 *    interrupt as it is above configMAX_SYSCALL_INTERRUPT_PRIORITY. 
 *
 * See the online documentation for this demo for more information on interrupt
 * usage.
