/******************************************************************************
 * This project provides two demo applications.  A simple blinky style project,
 * and a more comprehensive test and demo application.  The
 * mainSELECTED_APPLICATION setting (defined in this file) is used to select
 * between the two.  The simply blinky demo is implemented and described in
 * main_blinky.c.  The more comprehensive test and demo application is
 * implemented and described in main_full.c.
 *
 * This file implements the code that is not demo specific, including the
 * hardware setup and FreeRTOS hook functions.
 *
 * !!! IMPORTANT NOTE !!!
 * Some GCC libraries can make use of the floating point registers.  To avoid
 * this causing corruption it is necessary to avoid their use.  For this reason
 * main.c contains very basic C implementations of the standard C library
 * functions memset(), memcpy() and memcmp(), which are are used by FreeRTOS
 * itself.  Defining these functions in the project prevents the linker pulling
 * them in from the library.  Any other standard C library functions that are
 * used by the application must likewise be defined in C.
 *
 * ENSURE TO READ THE DOCUMENTATION PAGE FOR THIS PORT AND DEMO APPLICATION ON
 * THE http://www.FreeRTOS.org WEB SITE FOR FULL INFORMATION ON USING THIS DEMO
 * APPLICATION, AND ITS ASSOCIATE FreeRTOS ARCHITECTURE PORT!
