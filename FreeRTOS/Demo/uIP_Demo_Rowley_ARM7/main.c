 * Creates all the application tasks, then starts the scheduler.  
 * 
 * A task is created called "uIP".  This executes the uIP stack and small
 * WEB server sample.  All the other tasks are from the set of standard
 * demo tasks.  The WEB documentation provides more details of the standard
 * demo application tasks.
 *
 * Main.c also creates a task called "Check".  This only executes every three 
 * seconds but has the highest priority so is guaranteed to get processor time.  
 * Its main function is to check that all the other tasks are still operational.
 * Each standard demo task maintains a unique count that is incremented each 
 * time the task successfully completes its function.  Should any error occur 
 * within such a task the count is permanently halted.  The check task inspects
 * the count of each task to ensure it has changed since the last time the 
 * check task executed.  If all the count variables have changed all the tasks 
 * are still executing error free, and the check task toggles the yellow LED.  
 * Should any task contain an error at any time the LED toggle rate will change 
 * from 3 seconds to 500ms.
