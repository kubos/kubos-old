 * queue is empty or full.
 *
 * This type of semaphore can be used for pure synchronisation between tasks or
 * between an interrupt and a task.  The semaphore need not be given back once
 * obtained, so one task/interrupt can continuously 'give' the semaphore while
 * another continuously 'takes' the semaphore.  For this reason this type of
 * semaphore does not use a priority inheritance mechanism.  For an alternative
 * that does use priority inheritance see xSemaphoreCreateMutex().
 *
 * @param xSemaphore Handle to the created semaphore.  Should be of type xSemaphoreHandle.
 *
 * Example usage:
 <pre>
 xSemaphoreHandle xSemaphore;

 *
 * <i>Macro</i> that creates a counting semaphore by using the existing 
 * queue mechanism.  
 *
 * Counting semaphores are typically used for two things:
 *
 * 1) Counting events.  
 *
 *    In this usage scenario an event handler will 'give' a semaphore each time
 *    an event occurs (incrementing the semaphore count value), and a handler 
 *    task will 'take' a semaphore each time it processes an event 
 *    (decrementing the semaphore count value).  The count value is therefore 
 *    the difference between the number of events that have occurred and the 
 *    number that have been processed.  In this case it is desirable for the 
 *    initial count value to be zero.
 *
 * 2) Resource management.
 *
 *    In this usage scenario the count value indicates the number of resources
 *    available.  To obtain control of a resource a task must first obtain a 
 *    semaphore - decrementing the semaphore count value.  When the count value
 *    reaches zero there are no free resources.  When a task finishes with the
 *    resource it 'gives' the semaphore back - incrementing the semaphore count
 *    value.  In this case it is desirable for the initial count value to be
 *    equal to the maximum count value, indicating that all resources are free.
 *
 * @param uxMaxCount The maximum count value that can be reached.  When the 
 *        semaphore reaches this value it can no longer be 'given'.
 *
 * @param uxInitialCount The count value assigned to the semaphore when it is
 *        created.
 *
 * @return Handle to the created semaphore.  Null if the semaphore could not be
 *         created.
 * 
 * Example usage:
 <pre>
 xSemaphoreHandle xSemaphore;

 void vATask( void * pvParameters )
 {
 xSemaphoreHandle xSemaphore = NULL;

    // Semaphore cannot be used before a call to xSemaphoreCreateCounting().

    // initial value assigned to the count should be 0.
