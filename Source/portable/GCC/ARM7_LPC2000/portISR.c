	Changes from V2.5.2
		
	+ The critical section management functions have been changed.  These no
	  longer modify the stack and are safe to use at all optimisation levels.
	  The functions are now also the same for both ARM and THUMB modes.

	Changes from V2.6.0

	+ Removed the 'static' from the definition of vNonPreemptiveTick() to 
	  allow the demo to link when using the cooperative scheduler.

	Changes from V3.2.4

	+ The assembler statements are now included in a single asm block rather
	  than each line having its own asm block.
