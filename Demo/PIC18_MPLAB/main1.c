/*
 * Instead of the normal single demo application, the PIC18F demo is split 
 * into several smaller programs of which this is the first.  This enables the 
 * demo's to be executed on the RAM limited 40 pin devices.  The 64 and 80 pin 
 * devices require a more costly development platform and are not so readily 
 * available.
 *
 * The RTOSDemo1 project is configured for a PIC18F452 device.  Main1.c starts 5 
 * tasks (including the idle task).
 *
 * The first task runs at the idle priority.  It repeatedly performs a 32bit 
 * calculation and checks it's result against the expected value.  This checks 
 * that the temporary storage utilised by the compiler to hold intermediate 
 * results does not get corrupted when the task gets switched in and out.  See 
 * demo/common/minimal/integer.c for more information.
 *
 * The second and third tasks pass an incrementing value between each other on 
 * a message queue.  See demo/common/minimal/PollQ.c for more information.
 *
 * Main1.c also creates a check task.  This periodically checks that all the 
 * other tasks are still running and have not experienced any unexpected 
 * results.  If all the other tasks are executing correctly an LED is flashed 
 * once every mainCHECK_PERIOD milliseconds.  If any of the tasks have not 
 * executed, or report and error, the frequency of the LED flash will increase 
 * to mainERROR_FLASH_RATE.
 *
 * On entry to main an 'X' is transmitted.  Monitoring the serial port using a
 * dumb terminal allows for verification that the device is not continuously 
 * being reset (no more than one 'X' should be transmitted).
 *
 * http://www.FreeRTOS.org contains important information on the use of the 
 * PIC18F port.
