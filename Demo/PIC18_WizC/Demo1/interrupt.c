Changes from V3.0.0
	+ Added functionality to only call vTaskSwitchContext() once
	  when handling multiple interruptsources in a single interruptcall.

	+ Included Filenames changed to a .c extension to allow stepping through
	  code using F7.

** You cannot use local variables. Alternatives are:

** - Call a function		(Additional cycles are needed)
** - Use unused SFR's		(preferred, no additional overhead)
** See "../Serial/isrSerialTx.c" for an example of this last option
