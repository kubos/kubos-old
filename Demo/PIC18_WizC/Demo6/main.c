/*
 * Instead of the normal single demo application, the PIC18F demo is split 
 * into several smaller programs of which this is the sixth.  This enables the 
 * demo's to be executed on the RAM limited PIC-devices.
 *
 * The Demo6 project is configured for a PIC18F4620 device.  Main.c starts 4 
 * tasks (including the idle task). See the indicated files in the demo/common
 * directory for more information.
 *
 * demo/common/minimal/comtest.c:	Creates 2 tasks
 * ATTENTION: Comtest needs a loopback-connector on the serial port.
 *
 * Main.c also creates a check task.  This periodically checks that all the 
 * other tasks are still running and have not experienced any unexpected 
 * results.  If all the other tasks are executing correctly an LED is flashed 
 * once every mainCHECK_PERIOD milliseconds.  If any of the tasks have not 
 * executed, or report an error, the frequency of the LED flash will increase 
 * to mainERROR_FLASH_RATE.
 *
 * http://www.FreeRTOS.org contains important information on the use of the 
 * wizC PIC18F port.
