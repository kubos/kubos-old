/*
 * Creates all the demo application tasks, then starts the scheduler.  The WEB
 * documentation provides more details of the standard demo application tasks.
 * In addition to the standard demo tasks, the following tasks and tests are
 * defined and/or created within this file:
 *
 * "LCD" task - the LCD task is a 'gatekeeper' task.  It is the only task that
 * is permitted to access the display directly.  Other tasks wishing to write a
 * message to the LCD send the message on a queue to the LCD task instead of
 * accessing the LCD themselves.  The LCD task just blocks on the queue waiting
 * for messages - waking and displaying the messages as they arrive.
 *
 * "Check" task -  This only executes every three seconds but has the highest
 * priority so is guaranteed to get processor time.  Its main function is to 
 * check that all the standard demo tasks are still operational.  Should any 
 * unexpected behaviour within a demo task be discovered the check task will 
 * write an error to the LCD (via the LCD task).  If all the demo tasks are 
 * executing with their expected behaviour then the check task instead writes 
 * a count of the number of times the high frequency interrupt has incremented
 * ulHighFrequencyTimerInterrupts - which is one in every 20,000 interrupts.
 *
 * "Register test" tasks - These tasks are used in part to test the kernel port.
 * They set each processor register to a known value, then check that the 
 * register still contains that value.  Each of the tasks sets the registers
 * to different values, and will get swapping in and out between setting and 
 * then subsequently checking the register values.  Discovery of an incorrect
 * value would be indicative of an error in the task switching mechanism.
 *
 * By way of demonstration, the demo application defines 
 * configMAX_SYSCALL_INTERRUPT_PRIORITY to be 3, configKERNEL_INTERRUPT_PRIORITY 
 * to be 1, and all other interrupts as follows:
 *
 *	+ The UART is allocated a priority of 2. This means it can interrupt the 
 *    RTOS tick, and can also safely use queues.
 *  + Two timers are configured to generate interrupts just to test the nesting 
 *    and queue access mechanisms. These timers are allocated priorities 2 and 3 
 *    respectively. Even though they both access the same two queues, the 
 *    priority 3 interrupt can safely interrupt the priority 2 interrupt. Both 
 *    can interrupt the RTOS tick.
 *  + Finally a high frequency timer interrupt is configured to use priority 4 - 
 *    therefore kernel activity will never prevent the high frequency timer from 
 *    executing immediately that the interrupt is raised (within the limitations 
 *    of the hardware itself). It would not be safe to access a queue from this 
 *    interrupt as it is above configMAX_SYSCALL_INTERRUPT_PRIORITY. 
 *
 * See the online documentation for this demo for more information on interrupt
 * usage.
