/**
 * Manages a queue of strings that are waiting to be displayed.  This is used to 
 * ensure mutual exclusion of console output.
 *
 * A task wishing to display a message will call vPrintDisplayMessage (), with a 
 * pointer to the string as the parameter. The pointer is posted onto the 
 * xPrintQueue queue.
 *
 * The task spawned in main. c blocks on xPrintQueue.  When a message becomes 
 * available it calls pcPrintGetNextMessage () to obtain a pointer to the next 
 * string, then uses the functions defined in the portable layer FileIO. c to 
 * display the message.
 *
 * <b>NOTE:</b>
 * Using console IO can disrupt real time performance - depending on the port.  
 * Standard C IO routines are not designed for real time applications.  While 
 * standard IO is useful for demonstration and debugging an alternative method 
 * should be used if you actually require console IO as part of your application.
