/*
	The tasks defined on this page demonstrate the use of recursive mutexes.

	For recursive mutex functionality the created mutex should be created using
	xSemaphoreCreateRecursiveMutex(), then be manipulated
	using the xSemaphoreTakeRecursive() and xSemaphoreGiveRecursive() API
	functions.

	This demo creates three tasks all of which access the same recursive mutex:

	prvRecursiveMutexControllingTask() has the highest priority so executes 
	first and grabs the mutex.  It then performs some recursive accesses - 
	between each of which it sleeps for a short period to let the lower 
	priority tasks execute.  When it has completed its demo functionality
	it gives the mutex back before suspending itself.

	prvRecursiveMutexBlockingTask() attempts to access the mutex by performing
	a blocking 'take'.  The blocking task has a lower priority than the 
	controlling	task so by the time it executes the mutex has already been
	taken by the controlling task,  causing the blocking task to block.  It 
	does not unblock until the controlling task has given the mutex back, 
	and it does not actually run until the controlling task has suspended 
	itself (due to the relative priorities).  When it eventually does obtain
	the mutex all it does is give the mutex back prior to also suspending 
	itself.  At this point both the controlling task and the blocking task are 
	suspended.

	prvRecursiveMutexPollingTask() runs at the idle priority.  It spins round
	a tight loop attempting to obtain the mutex with a non-blocking call.  As
	the lowest priority task it will not successfully obtain the mutex until
	both the controlling and blocking tasks are suspended.  Once it eventually 
	does obtain the mutex it first unsuspends both the controlling task and
	blocking task prior to giving the mutex back - resulting in the polling
	task temporarily inheriting the controlling tasks priority.
