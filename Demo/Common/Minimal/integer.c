/*
 * This version of integer. c is for use on systems that have limited stack
 * space and no display facilities.  The complete version can be found in
 * the Demo/Common/Full directory.
 *
 * As with the full version, the tasks created in this file are a good test 
 * of the scheduler context switch mechanism.  The processor has to access 
 * 32bit variables in two or four chunks (depending on the processor).  The low 
 * priority of these tasks means there is a high probability that a context 
 * switch will occur mid calculation.  See flop. c documentation for 
 * more information.

/*
Changes from V1.2.1

	+ The constants used in the calculations are larger to ensure the
	  optimiser does not truncate them to 16 bits.

Changes from V1.2.3

	+ uxTaskCheck is now just used as a boolean.  Instead of incrementing
	  the variable each cycle of the task, the variable is simply set to
	  true.  sAreIntegerMathsTaskStillRunning() sets it back to false and
	  expects it to have been set back to true by the time it is called
	  again.
	+ A division has been included in the calculation.
