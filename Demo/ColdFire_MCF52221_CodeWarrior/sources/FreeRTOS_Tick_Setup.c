/*
 * FreeRTOS.org requires two interrupts - a tick interrupt generated from a
 * timer source, and a spare interrupt vector used for context switching.
 * The configuration below uses PIT0 for the former, and vector 16 for the
 * latter.  **IF YOUR APPLICATION HAS BOTH OF THESE INTERRUPTS FREE THEN YOU DO
 * NOT NEED TO CHANGE ANY OF THIS CODE** - otherwise instructions are provided
 * here for using alternative interrupt sources.
 *
 * To change the tick interrupt source:
 *
 *	1) Modify vApplicationSetupInterrupts() below to be correct for whichever
 *	peripheral is to be used to generate the tick interrupt.
 *
 *	2) Change the name of the function __cs3_isr_interrupt_119() defined within
 *	this file to be correct for the interrupt vector used by the timer peripheral.
 *	The name of the function should contain the vector number, so by default vector
 *	number 119 is being used.
 *
 *	3) Make sure the tick interrupt is cleared within the interrupt handler function.
 *  Currently __cs3_isr_interrupt_119() clears the PIT0 interrupt.
 *
 * To change the spare interrupt source:
 *
 *  1) Modify vApplicationSetupInterrupts() below to be correct for whichever
 *  interrupt vector is to be used.  Make sure you use a spare interrupt on interrupt
 *  controller 0, otherwise the register used to request context switches will also
 *  require modification.
 *
 *  2) Change the definition of configYIELD_INTERRUPT_VECTOR within FreeRTOSConfig.h
 *  to be correct for your chosen interrupt vector.
 *
 *  3) Change the name of the function __cs3_isr_interrupt_127() within portasm.S
 *  to be correct for whichever vector number is being used.  By default interrupt
 *  controller 0 number 16 is used, which corresponds to vector number 127.
