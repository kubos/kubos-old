; This file defines a wrapper for the interrupt generated each time the button
; on the target board is pushed.  The asm wrapper is used to save and restore
; the task context as a context switch may occur within the ISR itself.
; The C portion of the ISR is defined within ButtonTask.c.

; Include the portSAVE_CONTEXT and portRESTORE_CONTEXT macros.
